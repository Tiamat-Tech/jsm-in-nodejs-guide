# The simplest template, but with `.js` files

## Features

* main entry point using `main` in `package.json`
* Using `package.json` with `"type": "module"` means we can use `.js` files

## Pros

VSCode recognizes the files, and intellisenses them. Try it by Ctrl-Click to `add.mjs` and
hovering over `add` in `src/main.js` to see its signature
